There's a lot of creators and code makers, I am inspired from all these tutorials to help make a simple yet powerful light IDE, from my two favorite IDE's (one has to be made from scratch), that is the VS Code and the  NeoVem.  I have some projects I have pulling from to help and that information will be included in my README.md.  Can't wait to see what the collaboration of developers will help me come up with!
